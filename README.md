Non-linear regression algorithms are machine learning techniques used to model and predict non-linear relationships between input variables and target variables. These algorithms aim to capture complex patterns and interactions that cannot be effectively represented by a linear model. Here are some popular non-linear regression algorithms:

Decision Trees: Decision trees can be used for non-linear regression by partitioning the input space into regions based on different features and predicting the target variable based on the average or majority value of the samples within each region. The result of our code for this algorithm is follows:
